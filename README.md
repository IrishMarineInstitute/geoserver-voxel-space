# Geoserver Voxel Space

Retro-inspired 3D terrain from [Geoserver](http://geoserver.org/) (or any wms) maps.

Based on [John Hawthorn's Vancouver Lidar VoxelSpace demo](https://github.com/jhawthorn/VoxelSpace)

[Try the demo](https://irishmarineinstitute.github.io/geoserver-voxel-space/VoxelSpace.html) but be patient as it takes a few moments to load.
